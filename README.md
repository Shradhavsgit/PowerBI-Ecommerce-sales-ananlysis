### E-commerce Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard Development in Power BI

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales data and developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to provide clear and actionable insights. The dashboard allows users to track and analyze key performance metrics in online sales.

**Key Features and Techniques Used:**
- **Data Integration and Transformation:** Created connections and joined new tables to consolidate data sources, enabling a seamless user experience for exploring insights across various dimensions.
- **User-Driven Parameters:** Implemented user-driven parameters to support dynamic data exploration, allowing users to drill down into details through customizable filters and slicers.
- **Custom Calculations and Data Manipulation:** Applied custom calculations to transform raw data, providing calculated fields and metrics for advanced analytics.
- **Customized Visualizations:** Used a variety of visualization types, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line and area charts, and maps to represent data effectively. Each visualization was tailored to highlight specific aspects of the sales data.
  
This interactive dashboard empowers users to engage with data in a meaningful way, uncover trends, and make data-driven decisions for business growth.
